# House Prices Prediction Project

## Overview

I undertook a Kaggle competition to predict house prices based on a comprehensive dataset of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The dataset includes 79 explanatory variables, covering nearly every aspect of the houses. The challenge is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the final price of each home.

## Competition Details

### Description
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

### Practice Skills
- Creative feature engineering
- Advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting

### Acknowledgments
The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It serves as a modernized and expanded version of the often-cited Boston Housing dataset.

## Evaluation

### Goal
Predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, participants must predict the value of the SalePrice variable.

### Metric
Submissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price.

### Submission File Format
The submission file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
Id,SalePrice
1461,169000.1
1462,187724.1233
1463,175221
...
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is a Getting Started competition?
Getting Started competitions are created for participants with little to no machine learning background. They provide an excellent opportunity to familiarize yourself with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start engaging with the community.

### What’s the difference between a private and public leaderboard?
The Kaggle leaderboard has a public and private component to prevent overfitting. The public leaderboard reflects the model’s accuracy on 50% of the test set, while the private leaderboard remains hidden until the competition concludes.

### How do I create and manage a team?
Upon accepting the competition rules, a team is automatically created for you. You can invite others, accept mergers, and update team information on the [More < Team page](link_to_team_page).

### What are kernels?
Kaggle Kernels is a cloud computational environment supporting R and Python scripts, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. It enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Visit the Kernels tab to view publicly shared code for this competition.

### How do I contact Support?
